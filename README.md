My lab partner and I created a weather station using an AWS server IoT, an Amazon S3 bucket, Node-RED on a Raspberry Pi, and a DHT-11 sensor. We integrated a Streamlit application to display temperature and humidity data on a web dashboard.
We achieved the followoing objectives in the experiment: 
Learned how to set up and store data from a DHC-11 temperature sensor circuit to an AWS S3 bucket.
Gained proficiency in using Node-RED on the Raspberry Pi 4 to send data from the temperature sensor to the ASW IoT server.
Acquired the knowledge to setting up and configuring a Streamlit platform to display the DHT-11 temperature sensor data on a web page.
